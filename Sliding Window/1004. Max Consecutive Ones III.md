# Sliding Window

## Intuition

- Since we have k times to swap flip the 0, so there's a constain here that if the count is greater than k it is invalid, we should move the window to the right.
- When the window is valid we restart max comparing.

## Complexity

- Time Complexity will be iterate all the array, so it will be O(n), and the worst case is all is zero so I have to shrink all the zero from left to right, so it will be O(n), and the composite of time complexity would be O(2n) -> O(n).
- Space complxity since we are always using two pointer, it is constant so it will be O(1).
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

```csharp
public int LongestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = 0;
    int count = 0;
    int max = 0;
    while(right<nums.Length){
        if(nums[right]==0) count++;
        while(count>k){
            if(nums[left]==0) count--;
            left++;
        }
        max = Math.Max(max, right-left+1);
        right++;
    }
    return max;
}
