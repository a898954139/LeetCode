# Sliding Window

## Intuition

- This question is similar to Max consecutive ones, we don't need to take care of the original nums array, the only thing we need to track is how many buget of zero we've used so far.
- In this question, we only have 1 zero for buget, so when zero count > 1, then we shrink, and when zero count == 1, then we expand.
- This question has a critical case that is if there is no zero existing in the array, you must delete one, since we have the count of zero, we can check whether we need to delete one or not in the end.
- Since we 're going to delete the zero part, so we're not going to calculate zero when comparing the max number.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int LongestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int zero=0;
        int l=0, r=0;
        int max=0;
        while(r<nums.Length){
            if(nums[r]==0)
                zero++;
            while(zero>1){
                if(nums[l]==0)
                    zero--;
                l++;
            }
            max=Math.Max(max, r-l+1-zero);
            r++;
        }
        return max = zero == 0 ? max -1 : max;
    }
}
```
