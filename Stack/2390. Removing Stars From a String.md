# Stack

## Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of lowercase English letters and stars \*.
- The operation above can be performed on s.

## Intuition

- Star will cause the prev char removed from the string, so we use stack instead of queue, so we can easily get the prev element from stack.
- Since the 3rd constrain indicate that operation can be performed on s, and the operation is both _ and the element left to it will be removed, so there would be no case like start with *, hence we don't need to consider the edge-case.

## Complexity
Space complexity will be O(n) due to stack size will increse base on the input s size.
Time complexity will be O(n) since we have to iterate through the whole string.

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public string RemoveStars(string s) {
        var stack = new Stack<char>();
        foreach (var c in s)
        {
            if (c == '*')
            {
                if(stack.Count != 0)
                    stack.Pop();
            }
            else
            {
                stack.Push(c);
            }
        }
        
        if(stack.Count == 0)
            return "";

        var n = stack.Count;
        var r = new char[n];
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) 
        {
            r[i] = stack.Pop();
        }
        return new string(r);
    }
}
```
