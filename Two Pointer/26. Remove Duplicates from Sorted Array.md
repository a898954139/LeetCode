# Dictionary version

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(nlogn)
- Space complexity: O(n)

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int RemoveDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        var d = new Dictionary<int,int>();
        foreach(var n in nums)
        {
            if(!d.ContainsKey(n))
                d[n]=0;
            d[n]++;
        }
        var a = d.Select(x=>x.Key).ToArray();
        Array.Sort(a);
        for(int i=0; i<a.Length; i++)
        {
            nums[i]=a[i];
        }
        return a.Length;
    }
}
```

# Freqency array

## Intuition

1. This array is in an order of ascending, and we have to keep its order
2. I can have a frequency map to calculate the freq, and then iterate all the number that is equal or greater than 1 in freq array, its index would be the number and then overwrite the original int array

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int RemoveDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        var freq = new int[201];
        var writer = 0;
        foreach(var n in nums){
            freq[n+100]++;
        }
        for(int i=0; i<201; i++){
            if(freq[i] > 0){
                nums[writer] = i-100;
                writer++;
            }
        }
        return writer;
    }
}
```

# Set

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int RemoveDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        var set = new HashSet<int>();
        foreach(var n in nums){
            set.Add(n);
        }

        var count = set.Count;
        for(int i=0; i<count; i++){
            var e = set.First();
            nums[i]=e;
            set.Remove(e);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

# Two Pointer

## Intuition

1. I can have two pointer, one is write pointer second is read pointer, both writer and reader will start from 1, and check value index would be [writer-1]
2. If reader is not equals to [writer-1], then it means we found the diff, so we modify writer to be the reader value, and move both writer and reader pointer to the right, iterate till reader reach its end

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int RemoveDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        var w=1;
        for(int r=1; r<nums.Length; r++){
            if(nums[w-1] != nums[r]){
                nums[w] = nums[r];
                w++;
            }
        }
        return w;
    }
}
```
