# Two pointer

## Hint

- Find the largest substring

## Intuition

- Since it has to be seperated into two parts, so one of the substring needs to be attach to the end of string, either first or last.
- So base on this context we could know if first and last is both not equals, then it must not be palindrome.
- In other words, if one of them is equals, then we can find the largest substring to be attached to the end of the string.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

```psudo
public class Solution {
    public bool CheckPalindromeFormation(string a, string b) {
        var ap = 0;
        var bp = b.length -1;
        return Check(ap, bp) 
            ? true 
            : Check(bp, ap) 
                ? true 
                : false;

        bool Check(int ap, int bp)
        {
            // case1 full palindrome
            // case2 1 palindrome
            // case3 n < full palindrome
            while(ap < bp && a[ap] == b[bp]){
                ap++;
                bp--;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
